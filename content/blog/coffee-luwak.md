## Introduction 
Some time ago, the name kopi luwak had caused quite a stir. This type of coffee made from the natural process of a civet-like animal called a mongoose is considered the most expensive coffee in the world. It is even more astonishing because civet coffee turns out to come from Indonesia. As a result, many people want to prove how delicious civet coffee is to be named the most expensive coffee in the world.

Interesting when viewed from the historical side, civet coffee is not a new coffee variant. On the contrary, this coffee turned out to be known since the Dutch colonial era in Indonesia. So, how did the story of civet coffee start to become the world's most expensive coffee? Here is the full chronology.

## Brought by the Dutch
The history of coffee in Indonesia has not escaped the Dutch era. In the 16th century, the Dutch first discovered the most expensive coffee seeds in Yemen. Then, in the early 17th century, the Dutch began to bring coffee out of Yemen and tried to grow it on the islands of Sumatra and Java.

Some Dutch people who have plantations in Indonesia, then cultivate the most expensive coffee, so that it can be exported back to their country. Of course, those employed are indigenous people with a low-paid forced labor system.

## Continuing from the Curiosity of Coffee Plantation Workers
The owner of the garden deliberately forbids his workers to pick coffee berries. They are then curious about how the most expensive coffee tastes, considering that if they buy it, of course they can't afford it. Not long after, the workers realized that certain ferrets like to eat coffee pods. Only, the coffee beans are not fully digested, so what comes out with the weasel kotorang is still a whole coffee bean.

## Coffee Farmers' Brave Action
Some coffee farmers who dared to take risks, finally collected ferret dung. They separate the coffee beans and feces, before finally processing and drinking them. Who would have thought that the aroma is so distinctive, even in demand by the Dutch. Civet coffee has slowly become the main commodity, making it the world's most expensive coffee.

All Thanks to the Asian Coconut Weasel
Paradoxurus hermaphrodites or Asian coconut badgers are small, hairy, long-tailed mammals and like to live in the trees. In Indonesia, this animal is familiarly known as the mongoose, living at night (nocturnal), as well as fruit- and grain-eating herbivores. Interestingly, coffee fruit is a favorite food of civets.

Coffee experts also began to be interested in researching. They argue, if mongooses have the ability to choose the best coffee fruit to eat. This is also what makes civet coffee have a high level of quality. In addition, fermentation that occurs in the digestion of civets, causes changes in the taste of coffee. As a result, civet coffee, which is considered the most expensive coffee in the world, has a soft texture, and has a taste similar to chocolate with a fairly low level of bitterness of coffee.
